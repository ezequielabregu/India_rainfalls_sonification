# India Rainfalls Sonification

The dataset consists of records from 1901 to 2017 and contains information about monthly rainfall for 36 states in India.
Each column in the dataset represents the rainfall data for a specific month, indicating the amount of rainfall in millimeters (mm) for that month for all states in India, spanning multiple years.
Additionally, there is a column which represents the total annual rainfall recorded for each respective year, also measured in millimeters (mm).

The Rainfall Distribution In India are as follows:

1. Heavy Precipitation regions: These are the regions that experience rainfall of more than 200 cm. These include Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland, Manipur, Tripura, Sikkim and Assam.

2. Very Heavy Precipitation regions: These are the regions that experience rainfall of more than 250 cm. These include Coastal Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Lakshadweep.

7. The Himalayan region: This is the region that experiences rainfall of more than 200 cm. This includes parts of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh.

The rain quantity parameters were taken to control the frequency of a sinusoidal oscillator.
The resulting output is an audio and analysis (plot) of the data from each region of India.
